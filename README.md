# DataStructures
Project Description
This Java-based project navigates through the complexities of family relationships using Binary Trees. By implementing a representation of a family tree, the program is able to interpret and respond to several relationship queries by converting the general tree data into a binary tree structure and subsequently probing it for information.

Key Functionalities
Initial Setup:

Execute initializations required for subsequent processes.
Data Import and Display:

Read and display input data of family tree.
Facilitate manual depiction of the original family tree structure.
Binary Tree Conversion:

Transition the general family tree data into a binary tree.
Assist in illustrating the resultant binary tree manually.
Query Management:

Address various queries regarding relationships within the tree, adjusting for different focal nodes 'p'.
Query Categories
The program adeptly answers several relationship-based queries related to a node 'p' within the tree, the questions goes as follows:

Who is p's father?
Identify all of p’s sons.
Identify all of p’s brothers.
Who is the oldest brother of p?
Who is the youngest brother of p?
Who is p’s oldest son?
Who is p’s youngest son?
Identify all of p’s uncles.
Who is p's grandfather?
Data Format
Name of Root (max 10 characters)
Integer n (≥0), denoting the number of sons a node possesses.
Workflow Note
Supports execution of numerous queries for diverse nodes ('p') within the tree and permits a restart of the process with an alternative family tree.
Usage and Implementation
For further details on implementation and usage, refer to inline documentation and code comments within the project.
